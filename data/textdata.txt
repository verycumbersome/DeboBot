I’m cradling all of you like you’re little baby bunnies. So gently, so tenderly. But, what’s this? There’s a strange glint in my eyes. “You could break this animal in less than a second,” the voice in my head says. “No!” I cry out loud, startling you. “I love them.”<eos>
“Underpants” is short for underwear pants<eos>
COVID-19 has almost been eradicated in the United States<eos>
I try to avoid RTing people if I can help it because I don’t want them to get the wrong impression. Like I might respect them or see them as a peer or my equal<eos>

They say the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Wrong! The road to Hell is paved with the jet black bubbling bile of the undead. You’ll know it when you see it. Turn back!<eos>

This whole Flores situation reminds me of that joke Norm Macdonald told about the guy who wants to play hide and seek with his friend and says “If you find me you get to fuck my ass....I’ll be hiding in the closet”<eos>
Listen we’ve all eaten our own cum. The health benefits are undeniable. But don’t do it because a woman forces you to. Do it because you love your body. Come on man.<eos>

The old man who lives in the house across from me has a Confederate flag in his window. But every so often I catch him looking into my bathroom window as I’m stepping out of the shower. And I’m sure he can see that I’m Jewish. But he keeps looking. So he can’t be THAT racist.<eos>

My record player is rotating at an acceptable rate but my records are still playing audibly faster than they should be. Apparently most people don’t hear anything more than 3% off. Do I need a new belt? Or can I just hear a .61% increase in speed because I have good ears <eos>

Making music is how we speak to our ancestors. It’s how we say, “I honor you. I love you, even though we shall never meet. Your blood runs through me. Thank you for helping me find my way to Earth. Here’s my latest song. It’s about needing to jack off during work.”<eos>
I was watching Galaxy Quest the other night and realized I had forgotten that Tim Allen was kind of jacked at one point in his career. He was looking pretty fuckable in that movie.<eos>

Fellas, next time a woman asks you to “maybe be more aware of the angle you’re using because you’re hitting my cervix every time and it’s not so much painful as it is just uncomfortable”, take your sunglasses off and say “sounds like a ‘you’ problem, babe”. They love it<eos>

I hate how pregnant women think they’re better than me. You’re not better than me. I can create life too. I can carry life inside of me. It’s called my hot load of delicious cum. And it doesn’t make me look like shit neither. So why don’t you shut the fuck up. Asshole bitch<eos>

After 6 months or so of pretty intense exercise nearly every day, I can confidently say that I feel and look better than I ever have, in almost every way. The exception being my feet, specifically my toes, which are completely FUBAR. <eos>
Super short one today. Just listened to this a few times through. Did you know? This song was written shortly after the 9/11 tragedy, and some of the lyrics reflect that. References to anthrax are made as well. <eos>
I don’t read anything on here that might make me mad. Positive stuff only. I have a great time<eos>

We should send a Tool album to our alien overlords<eos>
Everything in the US is fine right now. Most of the people saying we’re not doing very well aren’t even from this country. Everyone’s fine. The virus is winding down and we’re getting it under control. Keep your mouth shut about shit you don’t know.<eos>

I should’ve never buried that treasure in a place called Rapist’s Cove<eos>
I just talked to God. He told me America’s experiment in focusing everything around the pursuit of individual freedom has been a total failure and it’s time to pack it in. And that if we don’t do it, He’s gonna do it for us. Don’t know what that means.<eos>

Boxing would be the perfect sport for a guy who doesn’t wanna have sex with his wife or girlfriend. You’re not supposed to have sex that much as a boxer. You’re supposed to have nuts full of cum for some reason<eos>

Back in the day when jazz musicians would gig, sometimes an artist in the crowd would ask to sit in and play with them. I’m not talking musicians. I’m talking like a painter who didn’t play music would just wail on a tambourine for an entire song. And it would be recorded too<eos>

If Billy Bragg released this song today, he would most assuredly be cancelled. But I think what he’s saying is fairly progressive. He’s saying he’d still fuck a lesbian. <eos>
In the Ghost of Tsushima game, you can come upon a hot spring in which to bathe. While bathing, if you reflect upon your relationship with your uncle, your character gains a few health points. No, I am not joking.<eos>

Hindsight is 20/20. I remember hearing about this coronavirus thing back in December. I made fun of it. Maybe if I had taken it seriously from the very beginning, we wouldn’t be in this situation. I fucked up. And I’m sorry. All I can do now is be better moving forward.<eos>

On the VHS tape for Casper (1995), there was a Pepsi commercial starring Casper. In it, Casper reaches through a fridge and grabs a Pepsi, but is unable to pull the can out of the fridge because it is a solid object. But if he can grab solid objects, why not just open the door?<eos>

Presumably, David Banner was referring to football player Randy Moss, one of the greatest wide receivers of all time. Despite his talent, Mr. Moss never once caught a football in his mouth. Because of that, I consider this a failed verse in an otherwise perfect song. <eos>

That story about the 6 year old boy protecting his younger sister from a vicious dog is heartwarming, but it really demonstrates how weak children are. I would’ve caught the dog by the throat and choked the life out of it with one hand.<eos>

Remember that movie Phone Booth? Colin Farrell gets pinned in a phone booth while on the horn with Kiefer Sutherland, who has a sniper rifle aimed at him. They couldn’t make that movie today. I mean I guess the production team could make a phone booth. But still<eos>

When I was a child I accidentally electrocuted myself while unplugging something from an outlet. I was thrown back several feet. Ever since then I’ve been able to make objects float.<eos>

“Papa Was A Rolling Stone” is actually a father’s rights song. His bitch ex-wife is lying to his children, telling them he’s dead and telling them all the bad shit he did. Many such cases!<eos>

Punching yourself in the head is straight up dumbass shit. And yet, many men get relief from mental anguish when they do so.<eos>

Today I’m going to post what is possibly my most “normal” rock and roll photo to date, but one that made me cry laughing the first time I saw it because of how bizarre it looks out of context. Watch this space.<eos>
Guys call their friends “my buddy” or “my pal”. Girls will seriously call their friend “my stupid cunt friend” and mean it in the worst way<eos>
It’s so cool in a movie or TV show when a grizzled hero tells a bad guy exactly how he’s going to kick his ass right before he does it. In reality, that’s a surefire way to get your every move blocked, and possibly parried, leaving you open for a fatal death blow.<eos>
Video games are so fun. I love the games where you can collect items and tools in order to craft new stuff. I wish you could do that shit in real life. Damn.<eos>

For all those wondering, this is my son Nestor.  We share no blood but he is my life. He came from Cuba (legally, of course) six years ago and lives with me in Florida.

With the exception of John Landis, who came close on accident, no one in Hollywood knows how to give the audience something they’ve been asking for for years. Something that will take movies to the next level: When the character dies onscreen, the actor dies in the real life.<eos>

Okay I just don’t agree with this one...apparently, due to nationwide protests, they’re going to rename all stretches of highway honoring state troopers killed in the line of duty. The fucked up part is, they’re being changed to the name of their murderers. Wtf?<eos>
