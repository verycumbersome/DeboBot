>|showonmapview|>
<|startoftext|>Just bought my first iPad and my first iPhone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my dog was born with cystic fibrosis. it is literally killing me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was told on "Drunk History" (A History Lesson) how it went like this:
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this is how it went when I was younger(maybe 10 or 11 or 12)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so glad i finally found some "pussy" that wasn't a "pussy" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what should i make my wife watch or listen to while i listen to this? What a dumb question. I could just buy a random music cd and tell her to listen to it all day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the only place anyone likes to go to is to their grandma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>trying to get a handle on my own manhood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>mood swings can be good, like a "good guy" getting the hang of things and becoming a more manly person. It can be bad like a "bad guy" becoming an adult, like "a bad guy" getting into a hot tub in the morning. but they always take a good guy in them both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i think i owe my life to the fact that there were times, when i was younger, i would have never have thought of "going to an All-nighter". im just a young person that has no patience for people that know better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>thinking of being the guy who puts on a shirt in the store that says "I get laid and my wife gets fucked". thinking of having to explain to my girlfriend how to make that on purpose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>they should make a "Furniture of the Month" category where i will go over the various furniture of the week and tell you things like the "Gone Fishing" chair, the apron bag, the bathtub, the washing machine, and every fucking other one. like that is a "Furniture of the Month".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i miss being the guy that gets to do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when someone says that their family loves "honey" i think of this scene from the movie "It's A Wonderful Life"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i know there is a whole generation of people who love to drink and smoke and do drugs. and no one here ever says this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i love being a guy with dick and balls. i love taking my shit on my head and getting it sucked by a woman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>being a "Mental" person (like i use to be) is an affliction of being born a half horse. being a "mental" person is a affliction of being born a monkey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>watching tv like its "funny"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to be fucking honest with my friends. If you werent in my chat room at 4am the other day you would be a "Waste of space"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>there are two ways to be a little bit better than the rest of the world at things the rest of us could do with less "knowledge"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ive been through hell, i know it, a few times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my wife is so upset with myself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it took a while but I finally decided to get on this thread and look at the pictures i had of my dog and i can say with confidence that my mind wasn't made for this shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the funny thing about the internet is that the world actually believes all of our "bewildering stuff" (I'm still working on this)<|endoftext|>
