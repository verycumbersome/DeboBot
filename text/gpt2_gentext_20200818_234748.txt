The Senate Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing on October 7th to discuss Russia's interference in the 2016 election and whether or not they believe President Donald Trump obstructed justice by firing James Comey.

If you are unable to attend this hearing, please email your questions to the committee at jeffreymclean@house.gov<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>America’s intelligence chiefs are reportedly "stunted" by Russia's unprecedented interference in the 2016 election, as it pertains to their nation's foreign policy.

Comey testified before the committee that he believes President Donald Trump obstructed justice by firing him.

In 2011 I wrote a song called “Cry Me A River” and it now has a Top 10 Singles Chorus. I love that the chorus is something we say in England sometimes and it's a bit like a prayer. It’s a bit of an R&B crooner and it does a good job of capturing the essence of that genre. It also has a sexy section because I do want to get pushed around a bit. But it works for some reason. Yuh. I love pushing people. I love making people do stupid shit. It’s what I do. It’s what I do. It’s what I do. It’s what I do. It’s “The Girl”. It’s a bit of a WIP because I’m still figuring out how to do my voice. It’s fairly gay-sounding but it does a good job of capturing the essence of what a girl would be sounding like. It also has a really sexy section because I’m curious. I want to try to fuck. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is cool. Definitely goes deeper than your typical superhero. What if we’re talking about the unconscious, mind…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an exercise I like to do sometimes. Play the first letter of the alphabet (alphabet, not the ones you write them with) out loud, in a very loud voice. Count backwards from there. Do this for every letter you’re good at. Count up to “10”. That’s how you get good at it. It doesn’t matter if it’s a numerical value. Play it really fast and hard. Count backwards from there. That’s how you build muscle. Count up to “5”. That’s how you build muscle. Count up to “4”. 

This is a great way to build muscle. If you can’t do it, just think of a bigger pile of letters. Count up to “10”. That’s easier. Now imagine that you can’t do it. Now imagine that you can’t do it. Now imagine that you can’t do it. Now imagine that you can’t do it. Now imagine that you can’t do it. Now imagine that you can’t do it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>you can just put them both on my computer and play and Skype is awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>they say the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Well, the only thing that makes this a hell of a lot better than any other road is having a good intention. i would suggest you take a good, hard look at your intentions. maybe you’re fucking with the lives of others. maybe you’re not. maybe you’re killing us all. maybe you’re just trying to be nice. Take a big ol' whiff of that hand of yours and you’ll be fine. Maybe you won’t. Maybe you won’t be so easily killed. Maybe you won’t even be able to smell your own ass. maybe you won’t even be able to taste your own dick. Maybe you won’t even be able to smell your own boobs. Maybe you won’t even be able to taste your own ass. Maybe you won’t even be able to taste your own boobs. Maybe you won’t even be able to taste your own ass. Maybe you won’t even be able to taste your own boobs. Ah, that’s the bad part of it. Maybe you can’t lift your dad because he’s so fucking weak. Or maybe you can lift him, but not very well. Or maybe you can lift him, but not very well. Or maybe you can lift him, but not very well. Or maybe you can lift him, and really lift him, and really, really well. But not very well. And the reason you can’t do that is because your parents are huge and strong and masculine. You are not strong enough to lift your dad. And that’s why you have to be very strong yourself, to be able to lift your dad. And that’s why your parents hate each other so much<|endoftext|>

My clothing choices seem like they are constantly changing. For example, I would never say I "Never wear a hat," because I’ve been hat-hunted before. However, I will say that I never wear a hat during pregnancy. I also think it’s important to have good taste in clothing so I buy only good quality stuff. I’m not saying I don’t respect good taste. It’s just that I don’t want to spoil my pregnant girlfriend with a bad piece of clothing. She’s trying to comfort me by wearing a hat.)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just feel like everybody should start calling me “Me First”. That way, I can feel respected and loved before I commit to anything. I can feel that I’m appreciated for everything. I can be kind of intimidating at first but eventually you get used to it. It takes a lot of courage to step into a new space. It feels good to make a huge statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pregnancy is such a wonderful thing that you can experience it with your own two eyes but it feels so foreign and strange when you first see it. It is so mysterious and unfamiliar. It feels so strange to have your penis removed. It feels strange to think that there’s a vagina in the US<|endoftext|>

I think I finally got rid of my cigarette but I’m not supposed to. I can’t take the smell of an oily hand. Is that right? Ah, yes. Smoking a cigarette is, on the contrary, the smell of a cigarette. I prefer, however, to think of it as the smell of a hand, than of a cigarette. So I will light another one. I just light one when I get anxious. Sometimes I light two and sometimes I light three. Sometimes I light four. Sometimes I light five. Sometimes I light six. Sometimes I light seven and sometimes I light eight. Sometimes I light nine and sometimes I light ten. Sometimes I light eleven and sometimes I light twelve. Sometimes I light twelve and sometimes I light thirteen. Sometimes I light fourteen and sometimes I light fifteen. Sometimes I light sixteen and sometimes I light seventeen . Sometimes I light nineteen and sometimes I light twenty . Sometimes I light twenty and sometimes I light twenty .

A group of wise guys come up with the idea of using a "shut the fuck up" strategy, in which they try to "Shut the Fuck Up" by turning their backs on them. Over the next century or so, they develop even more brilliant, if somewhat crude, shut-the-fuck-up strategies. But it's still basically just this: humans are having sex<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m trying to figure out why you’re always trying to show your penis to me.”

My penis is completely erect. You’re mistaken. My penis is phallic in nature. It doesn’t have a foreskin. It doesn’t even have a dome. It doesn’t even have a nose. It has a completely normal penis. It has no penis. So where’s my penis from? I can’t tell. It’s like I don’t even know myself. <|endoftext|>

My penis is phallic in nature. It doesn’t have a foreskin. It doesn’t even have a nose. It doesn’t even have a phallus. It’s just normal penises. I love being phallic. It gives me pleasure. It’s healthy to be phallic. It gives me comfort. It gives me strength. It gives me confidence. It gives me belonging. It gives me belonging. It gives me power. It gives me power. It gives me confidence. It gives me power. It gives me power.<|endoftext|>

In a world where governments around the world are slowly being replaced by private corporations, it's important to remember that we're still a small, isolated, self-governing nation. That means we have to keep the lights on, keep the microwave in the dark, keep the refrigerator stocked. That means we have to keep the key at the ready. That means we have to remember to light the faucet. That means we have to remember to light the lavender light. That means we have to remember to light the orange light. That means we have to remember to light the red light. That means we have to call the fire department when the fire department comes. That means we have to keep the car on the road for them to come. That means we have to have a fire extinguisher in our car at all times. That means we have to have a fire extinguisher in the house. That means we have to hire an attorney to wear. That means we have to have a fireman who is not just there to look out for us but also to impress us with his knowledge and skills. That means we have to wake up one morning and find that the, you know, curtains at our apartment have mysteriously disappeared. So we get up, pack up our clothes, pack our bags, head out the apartment and do it all over again. <|endoftext|>

can we just chill out man. i got a couple of things to say. i wont say what because i dont want it to be a CONFLICT of EVIDENCE that you either agree with me or you dont. i dont want you to think im bluffing when i say that im going to hit the jackpot but im not. im just really blunt. i dont want to hurt you. but i need to say it. so i say it. i dont really care what you all think. i dont want to hurt you but i need to say it. and it sets off a chain reaction i attribute to my high IQ. and it also thj e is called the intellectual.]]

“I could give my katana any number of names.  And it would still be the same knife.  It is simply that it has a number. “1” is the simplest. “3” is even simpler. “8” isnt so simple. You could give it any number of names.  It would still feel to you like a 1. It definately feels like a 3. It has a number.  And it has to feel beautiful to you. And it does. It has to feel that it’s beautiful to you. And it does. It has to “feel”. and it sets off a chain reaction i attribute to my high IQ. 

then what you call a “leeroy” or a “mare y’ou”. he is literally just a janitor in his car next door who smokes a blunt he picked up on the sidewalk as a prank. 

and the reason i call him that is because i knew him when i was 15 years old. he does not look at me. 

and that is why i call him “Ben”. im telling you, Ben is literally just another guy reading this. he looks like a fucking bus because of his awesome big nose and big heart. Its absurd. 

and that is why i call him “Ken”. im telling you, Ken is literally just another guy reading this. he looks like a fucking bear because of his massive penis and huge ass. Its absurd.
