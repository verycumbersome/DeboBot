<|startoftext|>white women be like "i dont see why anyone would want to work for them" and then be like "WELL. i just do not see why you would want to work for us"<|endoftext|>

====================
“I’m gonna make a big huge big fucking omelette<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doctor, we need to talk. I don’t know who you are but I need to talk to you. I’m not talking to you, I’m putting my life in your hands. Please come talk to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to make a huge omelette and I’m going to spill all over the back of the bowl. And you’re going to be here watching me eat and writing tweets about it. I promise you I’m not going to do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to put a boomerang in my tuxedo and make it swing around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone from France is French. Someone from China is Cantonese. Someone from India is Pashto. Someone from South America is Qu�m. Someone from the Middle East is Kufra. Someone from Africa is Mubba. Someone from Oceania is X <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to put a boomerang in my tuxedo and make it swing around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to go on a killing spree and everyone is going to be hiding in a closet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone send me the money I owe
Someone give me the money I owe
Someone send me the rest of the money I owe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The money is in the bottom right hand corner. Pressing the button will take you to the bank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter is like ..! More Like Twitter is like ..! More Like Like Twitter is like ..! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My followers are my colleagues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going on a run<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|
====================
<|startoftext|>I’m going to start singing. Just letting you all know I’m coming out and I hate this song. I’m coming out but I’m not saying I hate it. Just letting you all know that I’m coming out and I hate this song.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s insane how everyone assumed I’m straight when I didn’t even know someone who’s actually gay. It’s crazy how that stuff just happens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t wait to become that guy who does a Justin’s “gut” take and then plays the Justin’s logo for 20 minutes straight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to do a crazy dance that involves jacking off and falling down. You can watch it or not. I don’t care. I’m coming. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to do a crazy dance that involves jacking off and falling down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to do a dance that involves jacking off and falling down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A fan asked me on twitter if I’m going to do a “fun” take and I said sure. Then I did a take that involved me doing a funny dance but it wasn’t “fun”. I didn’t do a take that involved me dying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t think I can do a “fun” take because I’m serious. I’ve done plenty of serious takes but none of them have been “fun”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I was a boxer I’d be really scared of doing a “light” take. I don’t think I could pull off that sort of look. But I could probably do a “medium” take. I’m not even that scary

In 1871, a group of quarantined hollywood screenwriters came up with a fictitious employee who was nicknamed "The Dishwasher" because of how much he kept turning over

They called him "The Dishwasher" because of how often he got turned over

The guy was never supposed to work at a "Dishwasher." He was supposed to be a waiter.

I'm not even joking about this <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate how "Dishwasher" Jokes make me sound. I mean, sure, I wish he would just get a job doing dishes. But if he really wanted to do that, why not just get a job doing the dishes? Wouldn't that be nice. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m sorry, but as of 4:30 this morning, I have been fucking around and posting "I ♥️ M-F M-Favorites" instead of my normal rundown of what I do and see. I thought it would be funny if my followers called me “Mr. Classic Rock” instead of “Mr. Downloadable Content”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to do a weird thing today. I am not going to do “normal” things, like post what you normally do. I’m going to do “odd” things, like post what a lot of people don’t do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m doing a weird thing where I sit and look at a piece of paper for 20 minutes straight and sometimes I even eat the same thing. It’s an indulgence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is the last day to do your local pool. Do not do so. I’m telling you, the chlorine sucks. It sucks so bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have kids, make sure they know the difference between swimming and biking. I’m telling you, pool is boring when you get older. Plus, a bike is much safer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My doctor has told me I’m allowed to ride a BMX around town but not on the highway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m doing a crazy dance that looks insane and completely random when you first see it but as you continue watching you realize how much skill and coordination it takes to perform<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need a girl who won’t suck my dick and embarrass me. Can I get a hold of you. Can I get a hold of you<|

<|startoftext|>there are many things i like about my room mate  Josh but one of my favourites has been the huge pile of toilet paper that was always kept at the foot of our bed. We would never pick it up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>the doctor says i should try tasting different coloured fruits in the near future. i have always said that the fruit tasted GREAT when it was fresh but i always get pissed off when i try tasting fresh fruits. this trial will give me a great opportunity to hone in on my thoughts and preferences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my most significant personal cultural advancement in the past 20 years is the fact that i no longer think the majority of people in the world Cant spell certain words properly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you could probably put a fox in a cage with a human. theres alot of people who would absolutely destroy you for no reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realized that most of my followers are homeless. Guess i wont be around to have a drink after working 8 hours in a row outside in the rain<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m standing outside hooters with my dick somewhat out of alignment. a girl comes up to me and says “I heard about your boyfriend. He’s really hot. Let me know if he arranges some shit with me or not. I want to get married”. I move my head away from her, embarrassed. She continues to ask me questions like “how old you think she is?, and “when you’re gonna cum how do you know she doesn’t have it in her mouth?” I tell her none of these things. I move my head back to kiss her. She sucks me, and I keep my eyes on the ground. She keeps talking to me, and I can feel her tits. I look up, and she’s staring at me. I turn my head, and she’s holding onto my pelvis with one hand. She’s using her other hand to caress my balls. I stop kissing them, and she’s using her other hand to finger me. She’s using her other hand to cup my balls. I stop. I’m about to cum. She’s using her other hand to caress my balls. I stop. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can see it in her eyes. The fear in her eyes. The way she wants me to stop. But I keep moving, and she keeps coming.

The key to having a successful website is having a cool, interesting, entertaining, well thought out article that people click on, and submit to a fairly large audience. If you make an article that is 100% negative, subscribers will not even consider clicking on it. If you make an article that is 100% positive, they will click on it 100%. If you make an article that is 100% factual, they will go to the source and find out the answer. The more clicks I get, the more money I make, and the more articles I can read.

As a photographer who primarily uses his camera phone to take photos of people in interesting places, it is with some trepidation that I write this article. However, I will say that in certain light my favorite places to photograph are crowded places like subway stations and concert venues, and I would never dare say no. Nonetheless, I feel that it is important to keep my camera phone away from my most vulnerable subjects. I will not be taking my camera phone into the subway anymore because I have seen enough. Thank you, then, for reminding me to keep my promise to my readers. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I WAS READY. THE REST OF THE GROUP WONT.  CHECK THIS OUT <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing like a pair of murdered out slip-on vans 😎 <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People are always saying i should just commit to a single comedic voice.  You’re not alone. It feels so fucking stupid. I’m a mess. Can’t seem to stop thinking “Lil Uzi On The Other Sides Of The Bed”. I’m going to do a stupid song about a penis and then just kill myself. It’s an über-chorus duet. I can’t feel what the fuck is going on. I’m fucking Giuseppe Tornatore. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate comedy so much that i throw away my entire life savings in a fit of pique <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s crazy how some shows are 100% humorous while others are DEAD LIKEN. Like 90% of the shows i like are 100% joking. And the ones that are not are trash. I hate movies. I hate Stewart Lee. I hate Riza. I hate Dinesh D'Angelo. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to do something weird. I’m going to tie the knot of my uncle and the niece who took his place in court. No it’s not a cake tho. Its a joke. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m about to get a woman. One who smokes weed occasionally. A sweet tomboy. A tomboy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to do something nobody has ever done before. I’m not joking.  I’m actually  half human. I’m a man half my age. I’m 5’9’ in shoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can make someone fall in love with me in an instant. I can make them
====================
<|startoftext|>They should change the recipe for mayonnaise to "Wholemeal Italian"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love going to Whole Foods and buying wholemeal bread<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate movies so much that I throw up in their faces just standing still. But I CAN see why they'd want to make a horror movie out of my ass. It looks like shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just hate mayonnaises. They're obscenely French and stuffed with sour cream, onion, and maybe a bit of cheese. I hate them so much that I throw up in their faces and get really into their body reaction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to do something I’ve never done before. I’m going to say “I love mayonnaises!” in a movie. I don’t want people to see it, but I’m going to kill some people. I don’t care if it’s a spoiler. I don’t want people to see it. I’m gonna say it. I love mayonnaises. I love mayonnaises<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to do something I’ve never done before. I’m going to do a crazy dance that involves jacking off and falling down a stairs. No one knows. It’s a secret I keep. I’m not supposed to tell anyone. I’m not supposed to tell anyone<|endoftext|>

The Twitters have gone crazy for this one. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get emails. A lot of them are just "How are you like me"s. But you’re not. You’re not even remotely similar. So why would you send me one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going on a run this one take: 
“Running marathons 3 times a day gives me great energy” <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think of them as little gold coins. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My health is my greatest strength. So if some idiot is trying to kill me I’m ready. I’m never going to get the virus. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a gold tooth. I used to have a big baby, but that was long ago. I’m not really sure why. I guess I just hate the taste of gold. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every morning I wake up and ask myself “what am I going to be crucified for today?” I begin by looking at the calendar and laughing about the few things I did right. Then I eat a granola bar in my breakfast. Will I get cancer tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a few hundred thousand followers. Most of them live in far-flung reaches of the pacific ocean. But there’s a handful of them in my family. They all live in New York. And they all call me “Daddy”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to buy a gun and start answering phones. Just to be safe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My doctor says I should drink a full gallon of gasoline per day. But I don’t really want to. I’m too busy craving hamburgers and other delicious meals. I could probably kill my father in the family room<|endoftext|>

Hello everyone!

My name is Joel and I write scripts about my life. My first draft was about losing my virginity at age 9. I wrote the rest of the script after I lost it.

It is funny but it really doesn't work.

Why?
Cause I’m a bad boy.

Fuck you!

I’m the best guy to ever lived. Period.

I’m gonna change your life. Promise.

My First Experience With Weed :

You May Not Even Be Able To Make Fun Of Some People. You Just Have To Treat Them Like Human Being. Hell, Some Of Them Might Even Be Able To Pick Up A Stick And Throw It. No Matter What Body Part. No Matter What Job. No Matter What Language.

Anyways.

My First Experience With Weed Is Getting A Belly Button Piercing.

That Being The Case, I Would Rather Eat A Full Plate Of Steak Thighs And Find A Way To Gain 23lbs Over Weeks On The Dope.

But That Happens NOTHING SHIT.

Because Of Course I Have A Belly Button Piercing. I Just HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN UR GRAVEM.

<|startoftext|>I’ve gone to the trouble of putting together this little list of reasons why I don’t trust the pharmacy deliverer. No I don’t trust the pharmacist. I trust my food. I’ve eaten at a restaurant that had this in mind. But I didn’t order it. And I don’t want to. <|endoftext|>

If you slow your bike down a bit you can make a lot of friends and get away with it. And if you keep going at a normal pace you will get kked. Just keep your phone turned off. If you turn it on you will get kked.

I'm gonna get into some of my posts, because I, as a person who eats a lot of food, do find it interesting that certain people enjoy certain types of posts. For example, some people find it funny that I have several posts on my website titled “Wine and the City”, and some of them are WRONG. There's no reason why I should have multiple wines with the City, just because the City has a certain speciality.
I might even start doing a couple of posts with “Lunch for Lunch”, just because I like having lunches later in the day. These things will make me look smart. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a new kind of coffee. It’s   sort of like   toast “on the outside”, but instead of wet toast it has a layer of chocolate syrup underneath. It tastes exactly like normal toast, minus the chocolate syrup. I invented it’s just something I thought up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve eaten my fair share of french fries, and I’m sure many of you have had lunch at some point in your life. None of us have ever actually had lunch together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it’s important to have a hobby or interesting career in mind before deciding what type of work you would like to do. I have a few things coming up I would like to see. <|endoftext|>

He’s a normal guy. He just writes really intense pop songs. They’re really catchy. If you listen to them you will feel really bad. And they don’t involve sex<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to get pregnant in a little bit. But not like the normal way. Not like the normal way. Um. No I don’t want a normal vagina. I want a vagina that is actually accepting of me.

“The New Jim Crow” is an era of absolute racial harmony where everyone drives 1,000 miles per hour and the police never arrest anyone for breaking the speed limit.

This is a classic burger. I love burgers. I've been eating them ever since I got them on TV in the 90s. They're simple burgers made with tomato, onion, and sometimes a little bit of mayo. I like that the tomato flavor is so fresh, and I like that it makes me feel like I can tell the tomato if I like it or not. I like that the burger doesn't need much of a patty, just enough to make it interesting. I like that the onion makes it all the sweeter. I like that the condiments are nice and spicy. I like that I can mix and match them to make whatever I want. I like that they have onion chips in them. I like that they have ketchup. I like that they have mayo. I like that they have tomato sauce.

It was an absolute fucking failure. I ruined my life. I sent my food back. By the time I got to the US it’s still stuck in my fridge.<|endoftext|>

My brain is sort of a dumb ass, so sometimes I'll do something funny and people will laugh, sometimes I'll take a picture, and sometimes I won't.

====================
It is so beautiful to me when my friends on here ask me to take a picture with a beer in my hand. I know they’ll send me some nice ones, but I always refuse. Because I just want to be honest with them. I don’t have a beer in my hand. I just have a beer in my mouth. I don’t think about it. I just have a beer in my hand. It’s a beer that I made. Nothing more. Nothing less. It’s just beer. I wouldn’t know what a “good” is if it happened to be some random number. It’s something we define as good in our head. And yet, sometimes I just have a bad beer. Sometimes I can taste something I shouldn’t, and that’s also something I have to keep working on. Sometimes I even drink it straight. Both of these things are good, don’t matter what you think.

I hate it when I tell my friends I’ll never have a girlfriend. It just feels weird. But I’m afraid I’m gonna have to. I mean, I’m not totally sure I wouldn’t want to, but I’m afraid I’m gonna have to. I mean, I’m not totally sure I wouldn’t want to either. So here’s a guy who could potentially be a girlfriend for sure. Nothing wrong with that. Just nothing wrong with that. Ok. So he could potentially be my girlfriend. Now what’s your question?

Hey guys,

I'm doing a crazy dance that involves jacking off, then kicking my feet, then my ass, then my head, then my stomach, then my arms, then my legs, then my neck, then my mouth, then my wifes baby. She’s screaming in my other car. I’m doing a sex sicko routine but she’s totally into it. She’s taking pictures. I’m losing it.

You guys want to watch me do a crazy dance that involves jerking off and then jerking off and then jerking off and then jerking off. I’m not sure why you’re asking. I’m not sure what you’re looking at. I’m just doing my normal routine.

I’m sorry I blew this one out. I was just imagining a doctor doing an idiot run.

Anyway. Hope you guys have an evening.

Thanks.

I open my mouth and say something like  "I am going to try to keep my cool but at the same time I need to try to do something else"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its about that time again. Today i go rn and say the songs "Alone Together" and "Sparta" were written shortly after the 9/11 tragedy, both centered around a group of friends struggling to make sense of the sudden loss of one of their members.

For all those who missed it, here's what happened in the @NBA after the commissioner called the game "Starters" (stars) over the 5 games it was on:
In basketball, you win when your team scores 100 points. 
In this case, it would mean that the Cavs would win, if the Raptors lost.
In other words: 
the Cavs would lose, because no team ever loses.
the Raptors would win, because the NBA is "Starters" 
the Warriors would win, because the NBA is "Warriors"
the Mavericks would lose, because they are "The Spurs" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to change basketball forever, by inventing a new rule:
"If you can make it to the free throw line, then it’s a good play"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to invent a beer that both  men can drink at the same time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Rule, As I Know It, Since Its Original Use in 1932:
1. A beer is a "White" beer
2. No, I am not a "Red" or a "Blue"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you block the one spot on the basketball court where the opposing team can get to the foul line, they win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My favorite part of a basketball game is when one team gets to the free throw line and the other team can't shoot because they gave up. The best part of basketball is scoring 100 points. The best part of life is scoring some points<|endoftext|>
